Walter
======

**Walter** is a small web app written in ruby and [sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com). The unique purpose is to manage a directory full of quotes and the informations that get along.

It is also like very inspired by [toto](http://cloudhead.io/toto)'s architecture.

The name is of course a tribue to Walter Benjamin and his obsession for quotes.
